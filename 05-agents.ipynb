    "The core idea of agents is to use an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. You can learn more about agents [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/). In this notebook, you'll learn how to create an agent that can interact with Wikipedia. "
